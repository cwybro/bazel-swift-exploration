# [CW] 3/15/25 - Can't consume 'com_github_bazelbuild_bazel' as a bzlmod module currently due to issues with
# 'remoteapis' and 'googleapis' dependencies, which are consumed locally in the repository (which doesn't work
# when a consumer needs to pull them in transitively).

# [CW] 3/15/25 - Dependency on 'yams' is broken currently since the most recent release at the time of writing is
# 5.1.3, which depends on rules_swift@1.18.0, which is below our current required version.
